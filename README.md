# Wordclouds sharing space
This is a public repository that is a follow up for my tutorial (https://eddatascienceees.github.io/tutorial-JiriSubrt/)where you can post your outputs and code for wordclouds or different text mining data.

Hello lovely people! If you are reading this it probably means that you have completed my tutorial and you are keen to share your wordclouds and code with me. 

To add directly from your own R studio, you can connect your project with version control, or add directly clicking to ```add file```.

I will be looking forward to your creations!

Jiri
